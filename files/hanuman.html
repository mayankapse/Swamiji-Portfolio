        >Hanuman is the great hero of the Ramayana, the wonderful story’s most
        fascinating character. Though having the form of a monkey, he is said to
        be the greatest sage, yogi and devotee. What is the inner meaning of
        this magical figure and his relevance for everyone?</b
      ><br /><br />

      Hanuman is portrayed as the son of Vayu, the wind God. This explains his
      speed of movement, his power to become as small or large as he likes, and
      his incredible strength. But there are many other yogic secrets hidden
      behind his symbolism.<br /><br />

      <strong>Hanuman and cosmic energy:</strong><br />
      Today our world prides itself in a new information technology, with a
      rapid speed of data, calculation and communication. Modern science has
      learned to tap the latent powers of nature to transform our outer lives.
      Yet at a cosmic level, there is a deeper energy that runs everything in
      the universe, pulsating everywhere, which is ultimately much more
      significant.<br /><br />

      This universal energy is called “Vayu”, which is not just a force of the
      wind or air element, but the Kriya Shakti or power of action that governs
      all inanimate and animate forces. It is the source of all cosmic powers,
      not just wind as a force in the atmosphere. Vayu is inherent in space or
      Akasha as its force of movement and expression.<br /><br />

      Vayu manifests as lightning, electrical or propulsive force (vidyut) in
      all of its forms. This is not just the lightning that arises from clouds
      but the kinetic energy that permeates all space and time. Vayu is the
      energy operative from a subatomic level to the very Big Bang behind the
      universe as a whole. Tapping into that supreme cosmic power is what the
      methodology of Yoga is all about.<br /><br />

      Vayu at an individual level becomes prana, which is not just the breath
      but the life force that holds all our motivations and sustains our inner
      strength and will power. It is not just our physical prana but the prana
      of mind and ultimately the prana of consciousness itself, the universal
      life that manifests through the cosmic vibration OM.<br /><br />

      Hanuman as the son of Vayu represents the cosmic Vayu manifesting through
      our individual prana. This occurs when we dedicate our lives to the Divine
      Self or Rama within us, letting go of our attachment to the external world
      of appearances and connecting to the unlimited potentials we have.<br /><br />

      Hanuman endows us with the Atma-shakti or Self-power through which we can
      realize our highest potential and accomplish what is magical and
      transformational. He grants us fearlessness, self-confidence, daring and
      boldness to attempt the impossible and succeed.<br /><br />

      The cosmic Vayu is inherently a force of intelligence, linking us to the
      cosmic intelligence that aligns all minds together in an interconnected
      network of thought. That is why Hanuman is the most wise and observant,
      holding the power of buddhi, the discriminating inner intelligence that
      reveals the highest truth.<br /><br />

      <strong>Hanuman and the power of Yoga:</strong><br />
      This cosmic Vayu is the true power of Yoga. It gives flexibility of body,
      boundless vitality, indomitable will power, and dynamic concentration of
      mind. Our highest prana is to reach out and merge into the immortal Prana,
      which is to dedicate ourselves as Hanuman to Rama, to offer our mortality
      or temporal existence to the immortal and infinite.<br /><br />
      Hanuman grants all yoga siddhis of movement, energy, will power and
      wisdom, extending to the highest Self-realization, allowing us to master
      all cosmic energies.<br /><br />
      Hanuman is the conduit of the power of Rama as the universal Self. Rama
      represents the Self who guides all nature – through which the wind blows,
      out of which the Sun and Moon move, which holds the Earth in place through
      gravity.<br /><br />
      The real yogi works through that cosmic Vayu and universal Prana, in
      attunement and harmony with the whole of life.<br /><br />
      The true bhakta or devotee surrenders to the Divine will which is the
      motivating force of Vayu, the power of Rama behind it.<br /><br />
      Vayu’s vibration is OM or Pranava, the primal sound behind all creation
      and the source of all mantras.<br /><br />
      The Upanishads teach us that Vayu is the directly perceivable form of
      Brahman, the Cosmic Reality.<br /><br />

      <strong>Becoming Hanuman:</strong><br />
      To become Hanuman we must awaken to our inner nature as a portion of
      cosmic consciousness, a servant of the Universal Self that is Sri Rama.
      Each one of us has the power of the entire universe within us, but only
      when we surrender to Lord Rama within.<br /><br />
      We can only recognize this when we become aware of our inner Self, what
      the Upanishads call the antaryami or inner controller. Hanuman is the
      force of Rama working within us, the strength of our innermost self that
      is the ruler of al and the master of the universe.<br /><br />
      It is Hanuman alone who can discover Sita Devi. Sita represents the deeper
      Self-knowledge or Atma Vidya, through which Rama or the self can be fully
      realised.<br /><br />
      Sita is the feminine principle of space and receptivity that the cosmic
      Vayu depends upon and must protect. Without Hanuman, we cannot find Sita,
      and Rama cannot fulfill his destiny of the highest dharma.<br /><br />
      Let us not forget our own deeper cosmic energy in our fascination with the
      latest information technology that is but its shadow. Hanuman reveals to
      us the way of transcendence, so that we can work with all the energies of
      the universe, the cosmic mind and the transcendent Self. With the power of
      Hanuman we can master our new information technology and bring a true Ram
      Rajya into the world, which is about aligning our human society with the
      universal Dharma and supreme Self of Sri Rama!<br /><br />
      Jai Sri Ram! Jai SitaRam! Jai Jai Hanuman!
