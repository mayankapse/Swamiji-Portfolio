    <h1>What is Pitra Dosha or Pithru Dosham?</h1>
    <p>
Pitra Dosh can be considered as one of the most destructive and important element in Indian Astrology. 
But, it is often treated as the curse of your ancestors. However, half knowledge is pretty dangerous, 
so it becomes more and more important for you to know everything about the “Pitra Dosh” or “Pithru Dosham”.<br><br>
<strong>What is Pitra Dosha?</strong><br>
Pitra Dosh in reality is not a curse inherited from our ancestors or forefathers; rather, it is a karmic debt that needs to be repaid 
by the individual associated with Pitru Dosh in their horoscope. To put it simply, Pitru Dosh is formed in a person’s horoscope when their 
forefathers have committed crimes, mistakes, or sins during their lifetime. As a result, the individual is bound to repay this karmic debt by 
experiencing different punishments predetermined for these debts in different aspects of life. This cycle continues until the debt is cleared, 
either by accepting the punishment or by substituting it with acts of goodness.<br><br>
<strong>Different Types of Pitra Dosha:</strong><br>
As per the Indian astrology, a total of 14 Pitra-Dosha’s are explained in Astrology on the basis of planetary positions as well as aspects of 
malefic planets. However, an inappropriate position of mighty Rahu is considered as the major reason of Pitra-Dosh.<br><br>
<strong>Mainly there are 3 types of Pitra-Dosh:</strong><br>
Pitru Dosh can manifest when the family neglects important rituals such as shraadh, pinda-daan, as well as other last rites for their ancestors, 
thus resulting in a curse from the departed souls.
The curse can also arise from outsiders or individuals who were impacted by the actions of your deceased ancestors or living, known/unknown to you.
Neglecting the care & support of elderly family members, such as parents or grandparents, and leaving them to fend for themselves can also 
contribute to the formation of Pitru Dosh.<br/><br/>
